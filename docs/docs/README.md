# DesmJS

DesmJS is a collection of packages that allows developers to create DApp or wallets capable of interacting
with the Desmos chain.  

Inside this documentation you will find all the instructions in order to:

* create an instance of [`DesmosClient`](docs/api/classes/desmoslabs_desmjs.DesmosClient.md)
* use the various `Signer` implementations
* query the chain
* perform transactions
